## DisableBlipNameForVar()
Possible new name: `_GET_SELECTED_MISSION_CREATOR_BLIP`

Returns blip handle for mission creator blips only when they get selected on the pause menu map

Returns a value once when selecting the blip (or changing blips via the legend), must be listened for every frame

## N_0x4167efe0527d706e()
Possible name: `_HAS_SELECTED_MISSION_CREATOR_BLIP`

Returns true if hovering over a mission creator blip in the pause menu map

## N_0x3bab9a4e4f2ff5c7()
Possible name: `_IS_PAUSE_FRONTEND_VISIBLE`

Returns true whenever pause menu is open

Might have other criteria, but didn't seem to matter what page you had selected

## N_0xec9264727eec0f28()
Possible name: `_DISABLE_FRONTEND_INPUT`

Disables the front-end input (already documented kinda?)

Always used before changing frontend stuff

Not actually required, but seems to make sure player doesn't interact with half-implemented front-ends.

## N_0x14621bb1df14e2b2()
Possible name: `_ENABLE_FRONTEND_INPUT`

Re-enables the front-end input (already documented kinda?)

Always used after changing frontend stuff

Not actually required, but seems to make sure player doesn't interact with half-implemented front-ends.

# Front-End Scaleform Movies
### Using `PushScaleformMovieFunctionN`
These are all implying the use of the Blip Info popup front-end, `frontend = 65`, `layer = 1`

All of these are based on their usage in decompiled scripts

## SET\_DATA\_SLOT\_EMPTY(`int layer`)
`layer` seems to always be `1`

Clears all the data slots from the specific layer

## DISPLAY\_DATA\_SLOT(`int layer`)
`layer` seems to always be `1`

This function will show changes made to the front-end, changes are not shown unless this is used.

## SET\_DATA\_SLOT(`int layer`,`int index`,`int frontend`,`int unk0`,`int slotType`,`int unk1`,`int unk2`)
`layer` seems to always be `1`

`index` controls the slot position you're assigning data to

`frontend` appears to control which frontend you're manipulating

`slotType` defines the appearance of the slot (range `1-5`)


## SHOW\_COLUMN(`int layer`, `bool show`)
`layer` parameter appears to be the front-end layer. `1` is always used, `0` appears to modify other HUD elements, such as the map legend.

`show` parameter enables or disables the `layer`
